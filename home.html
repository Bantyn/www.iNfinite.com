          <div class=" text-center container">Cinematography (from Ancient Greek κίνημα (kínēma) 'movement' and γράφειν
            (gráphein) 'to write, draw, paint, etc.') is the art of motion picture (and more recently, electronic
            video camera) photography.
            Cinematographers use a lens to focus reflected light from objects into a real image that is transferred to
            some image sensor or light-sensitive material inside the movie camera.[1] These exposures are created
            sequentially and preserved for later processing and viewing as a motion picture. Capturing images with an
            electronic image sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel in the image, which is electronically
            processed and stored in a video file for subsequent processing or display. Images captured with
            photographic emulsion result in a series of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are
            chemically "developed" into a visible image. The images on the film stock are projected for viewing in the
            same motion picture.

            Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business, as well as for entertainment purposes
            and mass communication.</div>
